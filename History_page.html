     <h1 >  History Of The Web</h1> 
     <p>The history of the internet is intertwined with ARPANET’s own history, both of their stories begin in the 1960s.<br>
        1950s and 1960s:<br> In the wake of the Cold War, the launch of Sputnik in 1957 <br> by the Soviet Union led the United States to establish the Advanced Research <br>Projects Agency (ARPA) in 1958. The agency aimed  to maintain American technological superiority <br> by investing in cutting-edge research. In 1961, Leonard Kleinrock's doctoral thesis at<br> MIT laid the foundation for packet-switching, a crucial principle enabling data <br>transmission over networks. This concept would become integral to the internet's architecture.<br> The need for the internet was first born from the need for a decentralised computer communications system, and <br>this idea was created by military commanders during the cold war. Although the systems were later used for<br> academic facilities the networks’ structure was still the same as envisioned by the military commanders <br>
        J.C.R. Licklider, a psychologist and computer scientist, envisioned a "Galactic Network" in 1962,<br> anticipating a global system of interconnected computers. His vision influenced the development<br> of ARPANET, a project initiated by ARPA. In 1965, Lawrence G. Roberts published a plan for ARPANET, proposing the concept <br> of packet switching to efficiently share information between computers. This seminal document set the stage for the network's creation. <br>
        By 1969, ARPANET became operational,<br> linking four initial nodes at UCLA, Stanford Research Institute, UC Santa Barbara, and the University of Utah.<br> The first successful message transmission on October 29, 1969, from UCLA to Stanford—simply "LOGIN"—marked the birth of the internet. 
        </p>
       
    <p>1970s:<br> The 1970s witnessed significant milestones in the internet's evolution.<br> Ray Tomlinson's 1971 introduction of the "@" symbol to designate email addresses revolutionized electronic communication.<br> International collaboration led to the first International Conference on Computer Communications (ICCC) in 1972,<br> shaping the future of networking protocols. 
        The introduction of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)<br> in 1974 by Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn laid the groundwork for <br> standardized communication between different networks. This protocol would later become an essential building block of the internet.<br> By 1977, the successful demonstration of TCP emphasized  the feasibility of<br> interconnected networks. 
        </p>
    <p>1980s:<br> In the 1980s, the internet began to take its modern shape. <br> The implementation of TCP/IP, a protocol suite incorporating TCP and the Internet Protocol (IP),<br> became the standard for ARPANET. The introduction of the Domain Name System (DNS) in 1983, by Paul Mockapetris and Jon Postel,<br> allowed users to access websites using human-readable domain names instead of numeric IP addresses. <br>
        The establishment of NSFNET in 1986 by the National Science Foundation marked the transition from military<br> and research-oriented networks to a broader infrastructure supporting educational institutions and research centres. <br>The proposal for the World Wide Web by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 laid the groundwork for the creation of a user-friendly system for <br>accessing and sharing information over the internet. 
        </p>

        
       
        <p>1990s:<br> The 1990s marked a turning point as the internet expanded into a global phenomenon.<br> Berners-Lee's creation of the first web browser, "Worldwide Web," in 1990, facilitated user-friendly navigation of the web.<br> In 1991, the World Wide Web was released to the public, allowing users to access web pages and create content. <br>
            The release of Mosaic, the first graphical web browser, by the National Centre<br> for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) in 1993 revolutionized the internet's accessibility, enabling users to view <br>images and navigate more intuitively. Netscape Communications' founding in 1994, and the subsequent release<br> of Netscape Navigator, ignited the "browser wars" and propelled the internet's commercialization.<br> 
            The mid-1990s saw the removal of commercial restrictions on the internet, contributing to the rapid growth of online commerce, communication, and entertainment. Google's emergence in 1998, with its innovative PageRank algorithm, revolutionized web search and set the stage for the company's future dominance. 
            </p>
        <p>2000s:<br> The 21st century brought transformative changes to the internet. The bursting of the dot-com bubble in 2000 led<br> to a revaluation of online business models, but also laid the groundwork for future e-commerce<br> successes. The launch of Wikipedia in 2001 showcased the potential of collaborative content creation, while the introduction of social media platforms<br> like Facebook (2004) and Twitter (2006) revolutionized online communication and interaction.<br> 
            The launch of the iPhone in 2007 marked a new era of mobile internet access,<br> combining telephony and computing in a single device. The emergence of Bitcoin in 2008 introduced the concept of<br> blockchain technology, laying the foundation for digital currencies and decentralized systems.
            </p>
        <p>2010s and Beyond:<br> In the 2010s, the internet continued to evolve with the rise of platforms like Instagram (2010)<br> and the advent of 5G technology (2019) promising faster and more reliable connectivity.<br> The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 accelerated the adoption of digital technologies for remote work, education,<br> and communication, highlighting the internet's indispensable role in modern society. </p>

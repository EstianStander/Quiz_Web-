    <h1>Web Protocols</h1>
    <p>Internet protocols are simply rulesets that regulate data transmission and communication over the internet. The protocols apply to both sender and receiver. Another way of understanding it is that it works the same as speaking a language, every language has grammar and punctuation to follow, it works the same in that manner.</p>
    <p>Data protocols are needed because it is very likely that the sender or receiver may have drastically different situations such as: being part of a different network, being in a different part of the world or have different transfer rates. For this reason, we need protocols to manage the flow of data and the link between the two. </p>
    <p>To further understand internet protocols, we need to understand IP addresses. An IP Address serves as an address for an internet protocol, it uniquely identifies the device over the network and helps the internet identify different devices such as routers, websites and computers in a network. </p>
  <br>

    <h2>I will now give examples of some Internet protocols:</h2>
    
    <h3>TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/ Internet Protocol)</h3>
    <p>These protocols are the basic set of rules that allow communication between different computers. The IP protocol specifies that each computer has a unique serial number called the IP address. The TCP protocol specifies how data gets exchanged over the internet and how it should be broken done into IP packets, Additionally, it checks to see if the message has been appropriately transmitted to the intended recipient and ensures that the packets contain information about the message's source, destination, and recommended order of re-assembly. </p>
    <h3>SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)</h3>
    <p>The use of these protocols is crucial for sending and distributing emails. The protocol uses the header of an email to get the ID of the email receiver and then puts it into the outgoing queue. As soon as the email is delivered it remove sit from the outgoing queue. </p>
    <h3>PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol)</h3>
    <p>This is a communication protocol used for creating a direct connection between two devices that are communicating. This protocol outlines the guidelines by which two devices will communicate information and authenticate with one another. As an illustration, consider a user who both utilizes PPP and connects his PC to an ISP's server. Like that, PPP is used to link two routers for direct communication. (kumarankit4685, n.d.)</p>
    <h3>FTP (File Transfer Protocol)</h3>
    <p>File transfers between systems are done using this protocol. This utilizes a client-server architecture. When one computer requests a file transfer from another, the FTO establishes a connection between the devices and authenticates them using their ID and password. And between the computers, the requested file transfer occurs. </p>
    <h3>SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol)</h3>
    <p>Because it encrypts both commands and data while in transmission, SFTP stands for File Transfer Protocol over Secure Shell. By encrypting files and data before sending them via a secure shell data stream, SFTP functions as an extension to SSH. This protocol is used to connect to other systems remotely and run command-line commands on those systems. </p>
    <h3>HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol)</h3>
    <p>This protocol was developed by the www (world wide web) for the conveyance of information and is used to send hypertexts over the internet. The essential formatting and transmission criteria are described in this protocol. Furthermore, it details the various actions that web browsers should take in response to requests made to access a particular online page. Since HTTP is the protocol used to share text, photos, and other multimedia items on the World Wide Web, users are indirectly using it every time they open a web browser.	</p>
    <h3>HTTPS (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure)</h3>
    <p>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) has an extension called HTTPS. With the SSL/TLS protocol for encryption and authentication, it is used for secure communication over a computer network. A website typically uses the HTTP protocol, but in order to boost security, if it also handles sensitive information like credit card numbers, debit card numbers, OTPs, etc., it must also have an SSL certificate installed. Therefore, before entering any sensitive information on a website, we should check to see if the link is HTTPS or not. If it is not HTTPS, it could not be safe enough to enter sensitive information. </p>
    <h3>TELNET (Terminal Network)</h3>
    <p>TELNET is a common TCP/IP protocol that is employed by ISO's virtual terminal service. This makes it possible for local machines to connect to one another. The computer that is connected is referred to as the remote computer, and the computer that is connecting is referred to as the local computer. We can view any activity taking place on the remote computer in the local computer using TELNET operation. This uses the client/server model to operate. The telnet server application is used by the remote computer, while the telnet client program is used by the local computer. </p>

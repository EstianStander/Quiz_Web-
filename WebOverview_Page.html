<h1>Overview Of The World Wide Web</h1>

<p>The World Wide Web or WWW is one of the services offered by the internet, it serves as a global space for information or in other words a repository for information, it allows users to access or create vast amounts of information, documents or webpages by using hyperlinks which create a link that travels to that specific document or resource by using hypertext which is text that contains a link to a different resource inside of it, these links can then be accessed by a URL(Uniform Resource Locater) which acts as the address for the webpage, more than one webpage can belong to a URL it would then be called a website. </p>
<p>All these functions of the web are made possible by making use of the HTTP Hypertext Transfer Protocol which is the network protocol that makes the transfer of hypermedia documents on the web possible.</p>
<p>Nearly all web documents are made with Hypertext Markup Language/HTML which defines the structure of web pages through text using elements and tags that dictates how the content of the page is displayed. </p>
<p>The web would not be possible without its creator Tim Berners-Lee who had started work on the project in 1989 while working at CERN a Geneva based Nuclear Research Organisation. </p>
<p>The goal he and his colleagues were working towards was to create a global communication and information sharing system. After development the web was released to the public in 1991 and then made free for the public in 1993 . The web has had a couple of different stages of development over the years, each of them making the web more complex and adding new features.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Web 1.0</h3>
<p>The first stage of the web was called web 1.0. Web 1.0 widely regarded as the Read-only web lacked a lot of the features we have today. It was mainly used as a one-way flow of information created by a small number of developers that made websites, these developers were mostly associated with businesses or institutions. There was no user generated content in this stage and websites were static (Content was unchanging and coded directly into the webpage) and looked simple compared to what we are used to today since text and images were the only forms of content available on websites at that stage. The webpages weren’t the only thing that was limited in this era, in this stage dial up internet connections were the main way internet access was achieved and as such internet speeds were slow, because of this media elements had to be limited to not slow loading times down.</p>
<h3>Web 2.0</h3>
<p>The next evolution of the web would be web 2.0. Web 2.0 also known as the Read-Write Web had the massive revolution of user generated content which paved the way for more social uses of the web such as collaboration and social networking. Dynamic content also became possible since websites were no longer static and could adapt to user preference. Media also gained an advancement in this era since faster internet connections allowed for greater use of multimedia content.</p>
<h3>Web 3.0</h3>
<p>Web 3.0 also regarded as the semantic web is the current era of the web, we are currently in. It is characterised by user personalisation which has become integral to the modern web, by analysing a user’s response the results gained can be personalised for that user. Semantic data has also become integral. Semantic data refers to the practice where information is structured in such a manner that its meaning can be understood by reading it. The rise of AI has also happened in his age, AI has enhanced decision making and automation.</p>

<h1>The World Wide Web Vs The Internet</h1>
<br>
<h2>The Internet and World Wide Web are usually used interchangeably but are two completely distinct things.</h2>
<br>
<h3>The World Wide Web</h3>
<p>The WWW is a service that is available on the internet. It is a collection of linked documents and resources that can be found using web browsers and are designated by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs). The web is essentially a method of visually connecting information on the Internet, allowing users to jump between pages and resources by using hypertext connections. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, British computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee developed it.</p>
<h3>The internet</h3>
<p>The internet is a network of networks that are globally connected by using the TCP/IP Internet protocol suite. The Internet is a huge global network of connected computers and other devices. The World Wide Web and other services and technology, including them, are made possible by the infrastructure. The Internet includes a broad range of technologies and communication protocols that enable interaction between various devices and networks.</p>
<p>The World Wide Web is just one of the services available on the Internet; it also enables email, file sharing, online gaming, video conferencing, and other services. It offers the fundamental connectivity needed for devices to communicate with one another regardless of where they are.</p>
<p>In conclusion, a portion of the Internet is the World Wide Web. The World Wide Web is a method of organizing and presenting information using hypertext links and web browsers, whereas the Internet is the worldwide network of connected devices and networks that allows data to be exchanged and received.</p>

   <p>Hopefully it will help you understand the webs interconnectedness.</p>

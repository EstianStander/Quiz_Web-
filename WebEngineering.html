        <h1>Client-side and Server-side engineering:</h1>
        <p>To understand Client-side and Server-side engineering we first need to understand what client side and server side means. In simple terms machines on the client side seek information, while machines on the server side provide it. An example of a client machine would be your cell phone while a server is the device that provides the information you are searching for. You need to look at where a language is compiled to see whether it is client-side or server-side. It is a client-side language if this operation takes happen entirely on your computer. Additionally, a server-side language is one that runs on the server.</p>
        <p>Say your browser requests an HTML page while you are loading a normal web page. You will also receive any related CSS and JavaScript files from the server. Despite the fact that CSS and HTML are markup languages and are not compiled, we obtain this information from the client side. As a scripting language, JavaScript is already installed on our machine.</p>
        <p>What about languages used on servers, like PHP? These languages will perform the server-side compilation and provide you with the results. Let's imagine, for illustration, that you have a PHP file with the text "Hello, World." You won't see anything on the client side other than the output because PHP runs on the server and outputs the string "Hello, World." You can avoid having to view the PHP syntax in this method.</p>

        <h2>I will now further discuss development of client and server-side systems.</h2>
        <h3>Client-Side</h3>
        <p>Applications that run on the client's or user's device employ client-side development (front end). Developers on the client-side work on the user-interactive elements of websites. The goal of front-end development is to create websites that are aesthetically pleasing and capture users' attention. (O'Grady, n.d.)</p>
        
        <h3>Server-Side</h3>
        <p>Programming done on a server is referred to as server-side development. Databases and other applications that affect the functionality and loading time of websites are referred to here. Because web browsers, or clients, interact with web servers to get information, server-side programming is crucial.</p>
